        <h1>hello world...</h1>
        <h2>
            my name is lauren, and i'm a first-year student at <pink_accent>loyola university chicago!</pink_accent>
        </h2>
        <p>
            i'm pursuing a <pink_accent>b.s. in cybersecurity</pink_accent>— and i'm
            hoping to add on a
            <pink_accent> m.a. in criminology and international affairs</pink_accent> down the road, as well as a
            minor in psychology. since i grew up a little south of seattle i'll be pretty far from home (1732.8 miles!),
            but i'm very excited to be in chicago.
        </p>

            nicole perlroth's novel <i>this is how the world ends</i> inspired my interest in cybersecurity, and my time
            as lead programmer for my high school's first robotics team helped reaffirm my love for programming.
            i'm very interested in the ethics of cybersecurity, especially as it applies when interacting with
            foreign nations.
