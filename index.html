        <h1>hello world...</h1>
        <h2>
            my name is lauren, and i'm a first-year student at <pink_accent>loyola university chicago!</pink_accent>
        </h2>
        <p>
            once fall semester begins, i'll be starting a <pink_accent>b.s. in cybersecurity</pink_accent>â€” and i'm
            hoping to add on a
            <pink_accent> m.s. in computer science</pink_accent> down the road.
            i'm also interested in minoring in psychology or astronomy, but i haven't decided on which one yet.
            since i grew up a little south of seattle i'll be pretty far from home (1732.8 miles!) but i'm excited to be
            in chicago.

            nicole perlroth's novel <i>this is how the world ends</i> inspired my interest in cybersecurity, and my time
            as lead programmer for my high school's first robotics team helped reaffirm my love for programming.
            i'm very interested in the ethics of cybersecurity, especially as it applies when interacting with
            foreign nations.
