        <h1>hello world...</h1>
        <h2>
            my name is lauren, and i'm a first-year student at <pink_accent>loyola university chicago!</pink_accent>
        </h2>
        <p>
            i'm working on a <pink_accent>b.s. in cybersecurity</pink_accent> and minors in <pink_accent>math and computer forensics</pink_accent>— with goals to add a
            <pink_accent> m.a. in criminology and international affairs</pink_accent> down the road, along with minors in mathematics and computer forensics. since i grew up around seattle i'll be pretty far from home (1732.8 miles!),
            but i'm very excited to be in chicago.
        </p>

            nicole perlroth's novel <i>this is how the world ends</i> inspired my interest in cybersecurity, and my time
            as lead programmer for my high school's robotics team reaffirmed my love for programming.
            i'm very interested in the ethics of cybersecurity, especially as it applies when interacting with
            foreign nations.
