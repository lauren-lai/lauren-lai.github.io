    <h1>TEST C3 hello world...</h1>
    <h2>
        my name is lauren, and i'm a first-year student at <pink_accent>loyola university chicago!</pink_accent>
    </h2>
    <p>
        currently, i'm working on a b.s. in cybersecurity, hoping to add on a m.s. in computer science later. 
        i'm also interested in minoring in psychology or astronomy, but i haven't decided on which one yet.
        since i grew up a little south of seattle i'm pretty far from home (1732.8 miles!) but i love being in chicago.

        nicole perlroth's novel <i>this is how the world ends</i> inspired my interest in cybersecurity, and my time as lead programmer for my high school's first robotics team helped reaffirm my love for programming.
        i'm interested in the ethical issues behind cybersecurity, especially as it applies when interacting with foreign nations.
